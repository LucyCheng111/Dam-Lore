To run the website (for testing and editing purposes and if it hasn't been published to the engineering servers yet)

The Web site runs on FastApi and requires some library downloads. 
To run the webpage type "python -m uvicorn app:app --reload" and it will be available on 127.0.0.1:8000

To add new entries, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/adder, and add all information in the appropiate tabs. For the image url, either create your own postimages account and use that url or send the image url to Sjoerd with the name of the entry to add in retrospectively. 
If you are attempting to create a entry with a tag that doesnt exist yet, send a text to Sjoerd to request a new tag be created. (Tags are option selected to ensure semantics)

NOTE: THE ADDER.HTML IS TEMP AND SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE FINAL SUBMISSION. ONLY EXISTS FOR EASIER ADDITION OF ENTRIES
