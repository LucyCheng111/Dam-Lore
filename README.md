## Abstract
Our project is a website that provides users a comprehensive history of the OSU campus and the surrounding Corvallis area through a landmark map, 
location history page, “must-trys” and recommendations page, home page, and a creators team page. The website will serve as a cultural and historical 
collection for all matters such as building history, notable natural locations, cultural landmarks, unnoticed odds and ends, etc. 

## Goal
Our application will allow users to discover much more about the place they live/visit and give a better representation of Corvallis and OSU. 
It will solve the problem for students, visitors, and parents alike to find things to do close by and contain multilingual capabilities for 
the vast international community. 

## User Case Available
- User can open home page and see introduction of all the pages of the website.
- User can navigate to mission page and have info of our mission
- User can navigate to about page and see the info of team members
