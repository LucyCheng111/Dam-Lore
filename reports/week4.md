# Team report

## Goals from a week ago 
- Think of website functioning (1/27)
- Think of website design (1/27)
  

## progress and issues
This week we assigned people to different tasks. These tasks include creating basic pages(mission, tour page), 
interviewing culture centers at OSU, researching potential spots on our map, and switching from GitHub pages 
to class server (because of dynamics). We came into an agreement that we should get these basic things done to have 
our project move forward so we can do research stuff later. 


Issues we encountered were when we added mission.html. It didn't show up on the website. It's probably
a technical issue. Another issue is we are thinking of making our own icon landmarks, it's just a thought
we're not sure how we will do that. 

## Goals
- Creating "Our Mission" page (2/2)
- Creating tour page (2/2)
- Schedule interviews with culture centers at OSU (2/2)
- switching from GitHub pages to class server (2/2)
