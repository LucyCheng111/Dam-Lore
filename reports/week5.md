## progress and issues
This week, our team made significant progress on multiple fronts. We successfully arranged interviews with various cultural centers at OSU, 
which will provide valuable insights to enrich our campus tour content. These interviews are expected to offer diverse perspectives and historical 
context that will enhance the depth and authenticity of our project. Additionally, we launched the first edition of the Tour Page, which currently 
offers a foundational structure for showcasing the unique landmarks and historical information of the OSU campus. While this version is functional, 
we aim to refine it further to be more detailed and user-friendly, improving both content and design for an engaging user experience.

We migrated our website from GitHub Pages to a server-based hosting solution. This transition allows for dynamic content updates, improved performance, 
and greater scalability, enabling us to better manage and present our data.

One of the primary issues is the difficulty in assigning specific research tasks related to different campus buildings to team members.
Developing an efficient strategy to distribute responsibilities and track progress effectively remains a priority.

Another challenge is enhancing the functioning of the Tour Page. We are exploring ways to make the interface more engaging and helpful for students and visitors, 
including layout improvements, interactive elements, and clearer navigation. We hope to gain their visit experience at OSU with our website.
