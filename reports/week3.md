# Team report

## Goals from a week ago 
- Think of features(restaurants, history sites...etc) that should be included in the map (1/23)
- Think of landmarks that we can add to the map (1/26)
- Split into smaller groups for different parts (1/23) 

## progress and issues
This week we prepared for our project presentation and decided who was speaking on stage. 
We also did the project elicitation document which has a further detail of our project. 
After the meeting with the TA, we received some feedback on our project and found out we were focusing on 
the wrong idea and that we should focus more on improvements to the current website that has similar features. 

Issues we encountered were about time management, how we can arrange our time and balance between research and 
implementing codes.

## Goals
- Think of website functioning (1/27)
- Think of website design (1/27)
