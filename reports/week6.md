## progress and issues

This week we completed our presentation detailing the structure of our website, including its code, 
database, and team roles. We outlined our development plan, which covers testing strategies and design
This presentation allowed us to articulate our vision and demonstrate the functionality of our platform.

We received feedback from the cultural center. They emphasized we should focus on what OSU students truly need, 
rather than creating entirely new ideas. Our objective is to gather and present useful information in a way that enhances convenience for students. To improve our approach, 
we need to consider which landmarks and details should be featured on our map to make it as relevant and helpful as possible.

Challenges we faced was how to gather and organize information effectively. A key issue is determining the best way to research and collect data for each landmark. 
If we fail to obtain sufficient information about a specific location, we need a strategy to supplement our findings through alternative sources or direct exploration. 
Additionally, customizing our map to be both visually clean and user-friendly is also a problem we need to think about.
We must design it in a way that allows students to quickly access relevant details without being overwhelmed. 




## Goals
- Decide what landmarks to appear in our custom map (2/19)
- Decide what info to appear in our custom map (2/19)
- Assigning the team to smaller teams (2/21)
- Assigning small teams to research different parts of Corvallis and OSU (2/21)
